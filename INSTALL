------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building orbital requires you to have polymec 
(https://github.com/polymec/polymec-dev) built and installed somewhere, 
a recent version of CMake, and a decent C compiler. To build orbital on a 
UNIX-like system, use the following commands:

     $ ./bootstrap <build-directory>

and follow the instructions.

Installation
------------
To install orbital, run

    $ make install

from your build directory. This installs orbital to the directory you 
specified in your config.sh script.
